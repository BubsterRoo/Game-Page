# Game Page
!!!This is a work in progress!!!

Currently there are only two games created.
1. Flappy Bird
2. Tetris

These games are not made to the best of their abilities and still need a little polishing.
For example, currently in Flappy Bird, the player can flap off the screen, not recommended as you will still die.
There are also a couple bugs in Tetris with pieces not being able to go in the farthest collumn, making it impossible to clear a line,
and every-so-often, the piece will freeze at the top of the page and create a blockade. You can also delete any piece by putting another
piece on top of the piece. The game may also crash at point due to faulty code. I am working on it.

There will be future games, currently are planned for Doodle Jump and Pac-Man.

Current controls for each game.
